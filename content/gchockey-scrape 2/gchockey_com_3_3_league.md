**GAME ON! It's our Summer Weekly Skills and 3x3 Games**

If you're looking to get your skills back on track, this is the place! Our weekly SKILLS and GAMES will challenge you to work hard and push the limits on many key hockey skills like striding, stickhandling, shooting and crafty deke moves. Before you know it, you'll be at the top of your game right before next season starts!



The weeks will alternate between individual skills and 3 on 3 game play to develop your hockey sense and show off your moves. Over the seven weeks, you’ll receive three weeks of skills and four weeks of 3 on 3 games.


We need goalies for each game week at all level! Goalies are Free! Click the registration link below. Dates 6/17, 7/1, 7/15, 7/29, 2025
