### [This Summer Train the CARTER Method!](https://www.gchockey.com/blog/2025/03/21/this-summer-train-the-carter-method/)

##### Posted by Greg Carter

When it comes to summer and off-season training for youth hockey players, it’s super important to choose the right training method. While there are plenty of options, after 35 years of running successful hockey schools, we invite you to train the CARTER method this summer, and to train with the best!

**What exactly is the CARTER method?**

### **Control**

Our hockey camps educate all players on the importance of body control. We have designed a sequence of drills to help players understand and enhance body movements to **improve overall balance and body posture.**

### Agility

Our unique training methods focus on quick lateral movements and foot work. With proper body control and weight distribution, players will develop **evasive techniques,** making them more effective hockey players.

### Reflex

Hockey is a **read and react** game. Reflexes and split second decisions affect the game. Increasing your hockey skills (skating, stick handling, shooting, checking and edge control) helps to improve all aspects of the game. Through the CARTER method we raise the level of play and quicken your reflexes.

### Technique

We teach and improve hockey techniques under controlled situations and through repetition. We then incorporate **speed** once the proper techniques have been mastered.

### Edge

Edges are challenged and enhanced throughout the week using control and **overspeed drills.** Edges are incorporated into the skating stride through power skating and dynamic skating.

### Retention

Individual Skill Development. All of Greg Carter’s European Hockey School Training Camps work on t **otal skill development** through the use of European training equipment, parallel bars, and carousels.

Want to learn more and take your game to the next level? While many of our summer 2025 hockey camps are sold out, we have limited space available at select locations.

### [Score Your Offseason Goals!](https://www.gchockey.com/blog/2025/03/05/score-your-offseason-goals/)

##### Posted by Greg Carter

When the final buzzer sounds on your season the focus turns to **“What’s next” . . . “How do I improve my game?**” While most players share this thought, it’s the players that actually follow through, set goals and work hard tha hit the ice next season as a better player.

**So the question is, how are you going to make the most of your off season training?**

**Here are 5 tips to take your game to the next level:**

1. **Start with a plan.** This seems simple and obvious, but a plan isn’t a plan unless goals are identified and written down. Think back to last season and the difficulties that you had, identify areas of improvement and create a plan that will improve skills in areas that need the most work. Many players work on areas in which they are already strong. The great players spend time focusing on their weaknesses.
2. **Choose a program**. There are many options on how and where to train. Do your homework, and research opportunities that are reputable and offer training and skill development in the areas that align with your goals and objectives. Once you make this important commitment, you will be once step closer to your off season goals.
3. **It’s summer, enjoy it!** Off season training should be mixed in with a good balance of traditional summer activities. Hockey players that create a mix of training and fun are more likely to reduce injuries and also will stay with the program for a longer period of time.
4. **Dedicate yourself.** When it does come time for training, whether it’s before going to the beach or after a round of golf, focus on what you need to improve on. Put yourself back into the place you were last season and think about the areas of your game that frustrated you. Listen to your instructors and coaches and skate each drill with the same intensity that you play the game. Dedicate yourself to the moment!
5. **Split the summer into 3 periods**. June, July and August come and go very quickly. If you split your training and define goals for each month, it will allow you to focus and access your progress on a monthly basis. Players that we have trained at our summer hockey schools have told us they will identify 3 key areas of focus, and while they train all summer with them in mind, they may spend more time in June in shooting for example, and then shift the focus of July to power skating, and then August is all about stickhandling.

The goal of your off season training should be to improve your skills, increase your love of the game and to hit the ice this fall as a better hockey player than you left it in the spring. Good luck in all of your training and we hope to see you on the ice at one of our summer hockey schools [located in 13 states this summer!](https://gchockey.com/camps)

### [To Achieve You Must Believe](https://www.gchockey.com/blog/2025/02/18/to-achieve-you-must-believe/)

##### Posted by Greg Carter

Hockey talent is evaluated on many skills including stickhandling, shooting and skating.  There are also the intangibles including work ethic, coachability, hockey smarts and confidence.

Often the fine line separating talent comes down to confidence, not only individually, but also as a team. **With confidence comes poise and composure, and the ability to perform on the biggest stage under the most pressure**. You have heard players and teams described as having ‘ice in their veins’. This characterization is earned, through talent, experience and perseverance.

Recently a team was down 3-2 late in the game and with their goalie pulled and their ‘go-to’ players on the ice, they tactically moved the puck around the offensive zone with precision. They didn’t force anything, but instead, waited for just the right opportunity to put the puck on net, and tying the game.

With the clock running down the final few seconds, the top scorer wound up with the puck and just like that, the game was tied. Less than 30 seconds into overtime that same team scored the game winner. Sure, this included a little puck luck, but it was clear to everyone in the building, including the opposition, that this team believed without a doubt that they would tie the game. The players on the ice believed wholeheartedly that they were destined to tie, and ultimately win the game.

Not only did the team have the confidence, but individually, the players knew that they had the skill and the will to win. The players knew that all of the hard work and practice time spent shooting extra pucks, working on powerskating, stickhandling and shooting was going to pay off. They absolutely believed that they could achieve.

As the playoffs approach for this 2025 season, **do you believe that you will achieve?** Both individually and as a team? And once that final buzzer sounds signaling the end of the season, do you believe that you can set goals, work hard this summer and hit the ice next season as a bigger, stronger, more skilled hockey player?

**We invite you to take your game to the next level** at one of our [hockey schools located in 13 states this summer.](https://gchockey.com/camps)  We know that with some great instruction, hard work and dedication, we can help make you a believer, and an achiever!

Thanks for reading and good luck the rest of your 2025 hockey season!

### [Are you Gr8 at a Skill?](https://www.gchockey.com/blog/2025/01/27/are-you-gr8-at-a-skill/)

##### Posted by Greg Carter

Watching the great number 8 chase the all-time NHL goal scoring record held by “The Great One” Wayne Gretzky is historic.

Only 20 goals separate Alex Ovechkin (875 goals as of Jan. 27) from Gretzky’s once untouchable record of 894.

While a youth hockey player can only dream of being as great as “The Great One” and “The Great 8,” being high skill in any area of the game, at any level, is something all hockey players should strive for!

We’ve talked in past articles about great [goal scorers](https://www.gchockey.com/blog/2024/04/15/great-goals-scorers-perfect-passers/) and [tips on scoring more goals](https://www.gchockey.com/blog/2015/01/22/tips-for-scoring-goals/). Whether it’s skating, passing, shooting or scoring, being great at a fundamental skill takes hard work and dedication.

[Setting goals](https://www.gchockey.com/blog/2018/03/14/to-be-the-best-set-goals-like-the-best/) is the first step in mastering a skill. All great skaters spend more time on their power skating than average skaters. All great passers spend more time practicing passing than good passers. All great goal scorers shoot more pucks than the good ones.

As we watch Ovi chase the highest level of greatness, set your own goals on how you are going to go from good to great. Whether it’s increasing your goals from 10 to 15, assists from 25 to 30, or becoming a better skater, being great at a skill is . . . GREAT! Being great and more than one skill is double GREAT!

Thanks for reading and consider attending one of our summer hockey schools to help reach your greatness! [With locations in 13 states](https://gchockey.com/camps), our talented staff is ready to help take your game to the next level!

### [Don’t Think You Ever Deserve It](https://www.gchockey.com/blog/2025/01/17/dont-think-you-ever-deserve-it/)

##### Posted by Greg Carter

### When choosing a summer hockey camp, consider this sage advice from Rip at the Dutton Ranch to the young boy Carter. What does it have to do with youth hockey? Actually, quite a bit.

The best hockey teams have talent, they are selfless and play as a team, they have a burning desire to win and above all, they possess a super strong work ethic.

Several of our [Pro Tips articles](http://www.gchockey.com/blog/) have focused on [Doing The Little Things](https://www.gchockey.com/blog/2017/02/) that end up making a big difference. [To Beat You I’m Going To Out Work You](https://www.gchockey.com/blog/2018/10/) is great advice about staying focused and to never quit learning, developing skills and working hard. Said another way, the best players aren’t ever satisfied and always have an appetite for more.

Whether hitting the ice for the first practice after making the team or scoring a big goal to get to the championship game, the best players understand that once ‘they have arrived’ that is when the work really begins. Great players don’t think they deserve anything. Great players are never satisfied. **Nothing is given and everything is earned.**

Some of the best players that I have coached over the years are also the players that are the most excited when they make the team. And not just because they made the team, but more importantly, because they are one step closer to becoming a better player. These are the players that show up everyday, work hard on skill development and never take their position on the team for granted.

**Perhaps it is said best by these two great quotes from hockey players:**

Jack LaFontaine, a former NCAA hockey player who signed a rare, mid-season contract to leave the college ranks to play professionally. “I just got a ticket to the dance, **so now it’s time to come work even harder.**“

When NHL’er Nate Prosser announced his retirement, he said of playing in the top league in the world **“Every day was a tryout.”**

Just like Rip told Carter, if you want to last, don’t think you ever deserve it.

Thanks for reading and we invite you to train with us this summer at [one of our summer hockey school’s located in 13 states](https://gchockey.com/camps).Our Pro Staff will provide instruction using [The CARTER Method](https://www.gchockey.com/carter-method) to help players reach their full potential.

**If you are a player that is never satisfied and always looking to get better, we’ve got a great training program for you!**
