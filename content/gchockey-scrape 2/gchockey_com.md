## The Best Hockey Summer Camps.

Using the CARTER Method, skaters build on each days' skills and are challenged to reach their full potential as the hockey summer camp progresses. We don't teach systems or plays at our summer hockey schools – we leave that to your team coaches. We don't spend time off ice, either.

### TESTIMONIALS

Previous

Hey Greg! I hope this message finds you and family well in 2020!
Just a quick thank you for supporting the development of my son’s hockey experience!
Benjamin is at Georgia Tech and playing club hockey; a perfect ballcance of education and team sports!
All the best!

#### \- Mark

I feel it absolutely necessary to take a moment and thank you and your staff for the Greg
Carter Camp my daughter recently attended. I am new to the hockey world and until recently
had not heard of the camp.

#### \- Anthony Reda

I want to share with you the story below. We believe that a big part of John's development is
camps like yours and the focus on skating is a huge reason why John is able to control the
puck like he does. John is 9 and has participated in your camp at Canlan in Romeoville the
past 2 years.

#### \- Debbie Lane

We want to say, "Thank you," for a job well done. Our son Mason Haynes attended your summer
camp at Chilled Ponds; we've ​both ​not stopped raving about the camp to anyone who will
listen!

The accountability of the adults you had in place, Mr. Carter, was the best!

Your team pushed my son to be the best player he could be -- during the first day, he was
already noticing improvements and was asking to return to the camp again next year!

#### \- Kim Henry

Just wanted to drop a quick note to say your staff (Ryan and Ryan I believe the girls said)
last week were AWESOME!!!

#### \- Jess

My son recently attended the Greg Carter camp in New Jersey and I wanted to pass along how
great of an experience it was for both him and me. I was really curious in how the camp
would be different from other camps he has attended in the past. I spent the entire week
watching the camp and I truly believe that this camp is one of the best around.

#### \- Robert Barnes

This is by far, the best hockey camp if you want your kids to become better players and to be
tested to their max.

#### – Arlen Ayojiak

My three boys have done the spring league, summer 3 on 3 and the Sunday skill sessions, we
have had a great experience

#### \- Michaela Ann

Son just finished this camp in Northbrook and had a fantastic week. Very attentive coaches,
fun atmosphere, and a well-run program. Impressed!

#### \- Joe Rosenthal

My two boys had a fantastic time up in Plattsburgh, NY with coach Mike. They learned so much
in that one week and have not only improved substantially, but gained a lot of confidence in
their balance and skills as well.

#### \- Vincent Vitale

This is the best hockey camp there is for player development. If you are serious about the
game, you have to be skating with Greg Carter!

#### \- Jim Damren

My children love this camp! The kids are kept moving on the ice the whole time and I've
definitely seen improvements in their skating over the week! I would highly recommend this
camp to anyone looking for a hockey camp with great instructors and great results!

#### \- B. Richards

The teaching and professionalism from your staff was outstanding. They have gone the extra
mile to work with my son if needed, have made hard work fun and demonstrated great passion
for what they do with the sport of hockey. I am duly impressed and hope to send both my son
and daughter next year.
