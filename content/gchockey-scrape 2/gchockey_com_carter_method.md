### BUILD ON YOUR SKILLS. REACH YOUR FULL POTENTIAL.

We don't teach systems or plays at our hockey schools â€“ we leave that to your team coaches. We don't
spend time off ice, either. We teach fundamentals of skating, stick handling, and shooting, and we teach
in a way that builds confidence and leads to continuous improvement. Simply put, at our hockey camps and
hockey clinics we offer you the most on-ice instruction with the best results.

# RETENTION

Individual Skill Development. All of Greg Carter's European Hockey School Training Camps work on
total skill development through the use of European training equipment, parallel bars, and
carousels.

# CONTROL

Our hockey camps educate all students on the importance of body control. We have designed a
sequence of drills to help them understand and enhance body movements to improve their overall
balance and body posture.

# AGILITY

Our unique training methods focus on quick lateral movements and foot work. With proper body
control and weight distribution, students will develop evasive techniques, making them more
effective hockey players.

# REFLEX

Hockey is a read and react game. Reflexes and split second decisions affect the game. Increasing
your hockey skills (skating, stick handling, shooting, checking and edge control) helps to
improve all aspects of the game. Through the CARTER METHOD we raise the level of play and
quicken your reflexes.



# TECHNIQUE

We teach and improve hockey techniques under controlled situations and through repetition. We
then incorporate speed once the proper techniques have been mastered.



# EDGE

Edge are challenged and enhanced throughout the week using control and overspeed drills. Edges
are incorporated into the skating stride through Power Skating and Dynamic Skating.
