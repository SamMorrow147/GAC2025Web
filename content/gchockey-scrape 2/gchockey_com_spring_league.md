##### 2025 Spring league overview

![spring league](http://gchockey.com/application/files/5315/7669/2722/Untitled-1.png)

Our program offers young players, ages 5 through 17, the opportunity to work on their Individual Skill Development (ISD), while having fun!

Our ISD approach enables players to learn each skill - such as control, agility, technique, etc. - in a controlled situation. Once the techniques are performed correctly, players are challenged to add speed and push themselves further. **During the weekly games, coaches encourage their players to be creative with their new skills and moves.**

Our Spring League format includes:

- Five to seven 60-minute games (including playoffs)
- Five 50-minute skill sessions (varies by division)
- Playoffs for each division (up to 1 or 2 more games)
- One skill session per week
- One game per week
- Team jersey and socks
- Awards for winning teams

**Dates:** 4/29/25 - 6/7/25

**Player Cost:** $425.00

**Goalie Cost:** $150.00 games only

**Location:** Valley Sports Arena, Concord MA

### FAQs

Do you want to play with a friend?

No problem, just email us your request and we'll do our best to make it
happen!


What if the scheduled skill time does not work for us?

We understand that there are other activities going on during the spring
so we are very flexible with our skill sessions. If you cannot make your
scheduled time, you can attend a different skill session that fits your
schedule. Please only move up or down ONE level (age group) for safety
reasons (i.e., Gold players cannot attend a White skill session.)


Do you balance the teams / divisions?

Yes, during the first two weeks we evaluate the teams and divisions and
make the appropriate changes so the league remains competitive.


Can I Coach?

We are looking for qualified coaches to help with our league. If you are
interested please email us.
